## Convolutional Filters And Edge Detection

### Definitions
- Filter
- Edge
- High-pass Filters
- Kernel convolution
- Gradients: are a measure of intensity change in an image
- Sobel filter: commonly used in edge detection and in finding patterns in intensity in an image. Applying a Sobel filter to an image is a way of taking (an approximation) of the derivative of the image
- The Magnitude of the gradient: is just the square root of the squares of the individual x and y gradients
