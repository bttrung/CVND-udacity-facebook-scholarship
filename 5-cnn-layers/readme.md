## CNN Layers and Feature Visualization

### Definitions
- CNN's: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Convolutional layers: is a stack of feature maps - where we have one feature map for each filter
- Pooling layer: take in an image (usually a filtered image) and output a reduced version of that image 
- Maxpooling layers: look at areas in an input image (like the 4x4 pixel area) and choose to keep the maximum pixel value in that area, in a new, reduced-size area
- Fully-connected (linear) layers
